## Introduction
This project is a simple movie recommendation system that takes user input in the form of a keyword or phrase and suggests the top 10 movie titles related to that input. It uses the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique to analyze the relevance of keywords and phrases to movie titles.
